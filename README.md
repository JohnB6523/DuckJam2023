# Flow Runner

This game was my entry to the Duck Jam 2023 run by Duck Sauce Games. The theme for the Jam was Flow, and I built the game in Godot Engine.

This game is a first-person 3D platformer, in which you must keep an uninterrupted flow of movement. Your health is slowly depleting, and standing still drains it faster. Grab the golden orbs that appear around the arena to replenish some health, and survive for as long as you can.
